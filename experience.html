        <h3>Data Management Intern at Dexcom</h3>
        <p>Incoming Intern at Dexcom. In this role, I will be working on manufacturing data management and validation for continuous glucose monitoring devices. I will assist in data cleaning, validation, and analysis to ensure data integrity across different platforms.</p>

        <h3>Credit Analytics Intern at Axos Bank (Summer 2024)</h3>
        <p>In this role, I worked in the credit analytics department to provide data analytics solutions for commercial lending strategy. The primary project I worked on was building a report to show monthly trends in key lending metrics (LTV, FICO, Utilization Rate, etc.) for loan originations. I also built a report to show monthly trends in key lending metrics for all loans in the bankâ€™s portfolio. These trends were presented alongside trends in delinquency to establish which risk metrics were the drivers of loan delinquencies and defaults. I also worked on ad-hoc reporting tickets which involved editing and optimizing reports used for asset management and regulatory compliance.</p>

        <h3>Responsible Data Science Researcher at Purdue University</h3>
        <p>During this research experience, I had the opportunity to learn about responsible data management and machine learning. I trained a logistic regression classifier to predict credit ratings for prospective loan applicants. I developed a script to calculate machine learning fairness metrics based on a peer-reviewed paper. These metrics included well calibration, equalized odds, causal discrimination, and fairness through unawareness. I am currently working on identifying which data points contribute to model bias through the use of Shapley values and influence functions. I am prototyping an estimation of the influence value and testing to see if estimated influence values align with "ground-truth" values obtained through a leave-one-out approach.</p>

        <h3>ML Researcher at Purdue University (2024-2025 Academic Year)</h3>
        <p>During this experience, I learned about state-of-the-art topics in machine learning. I began this experience by learning about foundation models, such as transformers and diffusion models. I worked on background tasks for a project on solving stochastic PDEs using diffusion models. These background tasks included recreating a dataset of stochastic PDEs and their solutions that was used in a prior study, prototyping diffusion hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, and implementing a probabilistic diffusion model from scratch. I also performed literature reviews to learn about topics such as diffusion models, masked autoencoders, and partial differential equations. Later on, I worked for a bit on a project that involved graph diffusion policy optimization. I worked to reproduce the results of a prior study that used graph diffusion policy optimization for generative modeling of chemical structures of drugs. Currently, I am learning more about optimal transport and learning a continuous trajectory between distributions using stochastic samples from each distribution.</p>

  <h3>Data Science Researcher at Purdue University</h3>
  <p>
    This experience was a corporate partnership as part of the Data Mine learning community. In this role, I worked on identifying algal contamination in lakes and rivers within the State of Indiana. I collected satellite image data from the Sentinel Hub EO Browser and leveraged methods such as image tiling and data augmentations to build a dataset of true color image tiles and corresponding water quality masks. I then developed a U-Net model for semantic segmentation to create a water quality mask from a true color image tile in order to assess where in a lake or river water quality issues existed. I also helped fine-tune a pretrained ResNet50 classifier to detect true color image tiles that showed signs of significant algae contamination. I presented my findings along with my group at the annual Data Mine Symposium.
