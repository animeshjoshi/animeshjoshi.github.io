          Hi! I am Animesh Joshi, an undergraduate student at Purdue University studying Mathematics and Statistics. I will be working as a data management intern at Dexcom over the summer, and I previously worked as a credit risk analytics intern at Axos Bank. I am currently participating in research relating to fairness violations in machine learning models and data valuation. I have previously worked on research projects involving foundation models, deep learning, and computer vision. More generally, I am interested in Statistical Methodology, Causal Inference, and Machine Learning.
