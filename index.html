      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at Purdue University majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. This summer, I'll be working as a Data Management Intern at Dexcom. Previously, I worked at Axos Bank as a Credit Risk Analytics Intern. Currently, I'm conducting research at Purdue focused on understanding fairness violations in machine learning and identifying the data points that cause them. More broadly, I'm interested in Statistical Inference, Causal Inference, Econometrics, and Machine Learning.

        <h3>Data Management Intern - Dexcom</h3>
        <p>
          Incoming intern at Dexcom. In this role, I will be working on manufacturing data management and validation. This involves ensuring data is properly managed throughout the production process, supporting quality assurance efforts, and working closely with other departments to ensure proper data integrity.

        <h3>Credit Analytics Intern - Axos Bank</h3>
        <p>
          In this role, I worked in the credit analytics department to provide data analytics solutions for commercial lending strategy. I built a report to show monthly trends in key lending metrics like Loan-to-Value (LTV), FICO scores, and Utilization Rates. Additionally, I created reports that showed trends for all loans in the bank’s portfolio, which were presented alongside delinquency trends to identify key risk factors driving loan defaults.

        <h3>Responsible Data Science Researcher - Purdue University</h3>
        <p>
          During this research experience, I trained a logistic regression classifier to predict credit ratings for prospective loan applicants. I also developed a script to calculate machine learning fairness metrics, including well calibration, equalized odds, and causal discrimination. Currently, I am working on identifying which data points contribute to model bias through the use of Shapley values and influence functions. I am prototyping an estimation of the influence value and testing it to align with ground-truth values.

        <h3>ML Researcher - Purdue University</h3>
        <p>
          During this experience, I worked on various cutting-edge topics in machine learning. I initially learned about foundation models like transformers and diffusion models, later working on solving stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs) using diffusion models. I contributed to prototyping hyperparameter optimization using Optuna and implementing a probabilistic diffusion model. I also participated in reproducing results from studies on graph diffusion policy optimization for generative modeling of chemical structures in drug development.

        <h3>Data Science Researcher - Purdue University</h3>
        <p>
          As part of a corporate partnership with the Data Mine learning community, I worked on identifying algal contamination in lakes and rivers within Indiana. I collected satellite image data, using methods such as image tiling and data augmentation to build a dataset of true-color image tiles. I developed a U-Net model for semantic segmentation to identify water quality issues and fine-tuned a pretrained ResNet50 classifier to detect significant algae contamination. I presented my findings at the annual Data Mine Symposium.
