    <p>
      Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at Purdue University majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. 
      This summer, I'll be working as a Data Management Intern at Dexcom. Previously, I worked at 
      Axos Bank as a Credit Risk Analytics Intern. Currently, I'm conducting research at Purdue 
      focused on understanding fairness violations in machine learning and identifying the data points 
      that cause them. More broadly, I'm interested in Statistical Inference, Causal Inference, 
      Econometrics, and Machine Learning.
